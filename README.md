# House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques
Through this project, I implemented a machine learning model that predicts the selling price of a house according to 79 characteristics.   

This is a Kaggle competition (House Price Regression), in which I finished in the first quarter  with more than 4000 entries (almost top 26%).

## What did I learn?

- **Developed my data cleansing and transformation skills** Working with a large dataset requiring a lot of data cleansing
- **Refined feature engineering techniques** to improve the performance of my model 
- **Built a checklist** to improve my workflow and be more organized in my project
- **Improved my personal library** to compare different models
<br>

## Why this project?
to improve my skills and have a better understanding of how classical regression models work I used the book Introduction to statistical learning to understand in depth and tune my models.
